Luminary Workshop Website Source Code

This website was a project done in collaboration with the great people at Luminary Workshop. 
The majority of the code used is from 3rd party templates and plug ins, but modified and restructured for the needs of LW.
All pictures are property of Zachary Kellogg (Photographer and owner) of LW. 
All copywrite is original written content by me with input and and tweaks made with LW employees.
